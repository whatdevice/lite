# WhatDevice Lite

This is a custom version of WhatDevice, designed to run on legacy browsers or basic WAP browsers. It has been tested to work on Internet Explorer 5, 7, and 8 (through IE11's compatibility mode) as well as Opera Mini.

WhatDevice Lite uses components from [Progressive Internet Explorer](https://github.com/lojjic/PIE). The favicon came from [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/45175/cpu_fan_icon).
